# This repository hosts example notebooks for the UCSC ASTR21 course.

## You can run the notebooks without needing to install any software using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.

Here's how to open an example notebook:

1) Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2) If a menu hasn't popped up already, go to "File" in the top left, and click "Open notebook."

3) Click on "Github" in the list of options on the left,
under "Open Notebook".
   
4) Enter [https://github.com/stephsallum/intro_python](https://github.com/stephsallum/astr21) into the
Github URL search box.

5) Click on the notebook you want to run.

The following [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) provides a nice
introduction to using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks.
