# These are example notebooks for the UCSC ASTR21 course.

## You can run the notebooks without needing to install any software using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.

Here's how to open an example notebook:

1) Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2) Click on "Github" in the list of options on the left,
under "Open Notebook".
   
3) Enter https://github.com/stephsallum/intro_python into the
Github URL search box.

4) Click on the notebook you want to run.

The following [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) provides a nice
introduction to using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks.
